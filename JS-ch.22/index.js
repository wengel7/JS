//Difference between var and let = variable scope meaning 
//where the can be called and used

//let = variable are limited to block scope "{}"
//val = variable are limitied to a function(){} otherwise if 
//      it is inside a loop or something it will be recognized

//another thing is a global variable = is declared outside any function
//                                     (if global,var will CHANGE browser's window properties)
//                                     y coz it changes a window object which will be discussed later     

let name = "somebody";
